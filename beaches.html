        <h2>White Sand Beaches</h2>

        <p>Venture outside the city to experience Iloilo’s friendly countrysides and hidden gems. Iloilo
            Province
            is filled with many natural and cultural spots worth exploring. Picturesque beaches are scattered
            across the
            seafood rich waters of Northern Iloilo where the islands of Gigantes , Concepcion, Ajuy, and Sicogon
            beckon. The southern
            coast of Iloilo is lined well-preserved marine sanctuaries and many of the province’s oldest
            churches including Miagao
            Church and San Joaquin Church. For nature lovers, there are many refreshing waterfalls, hiking
            trails, and cool
            highland areas in Iloilo’s central mountains, just waiting to be discovered.</p>
