        <h2>Best Foods</h2>

        <p>Food is undoubtedly Iloilo’s biggest year-round attraction. Most true-blooded locals will, without fail,
            offer to take
            you to eat at local restaurants or prepare a home-cooked Ilonggo meal if they find out that you’re a
            first-time visitor.
            Don’t miss out on savoring fresh seafood and Iloilo’s native cuisine, especially its signature dishes like
            La Paz
            Batchoy and Pancit Molo.</p>
        <p>La Paz Batchoy is one of Iloilo’s best-known signature dishes and a must-try delicacy served in restaurants
            all over Iloilo City. This noodle soup is made with miki, (round noodles), pork organs (liver, spleen,
            kidneys and heart), chicken stock, beef loin, shrimp stock, and garnished with chicharon (pork cracklings).

        <p>Said to have originated from the town of Molo in the province of Iloilo and influenced by the wonton soups
            brought in by the large community of Chinese settlers in the area, pancit molo is a soup dish made of
            meat-filled dumplings, shredded chicken and a robust broth. The piping-hot soup is ladled into serving
            bowls, and garnished with green onions and fried garlic bits for another layer of flavor.</p>
